Developers progress from direct SQL to ORMs. This talk will explain what ORM's bring to the table, give overview of different ORM patterns and go through several popular ORM's. A minimalistic ORM called Idiorm will be presented. Idiorm is ideal for beginners learning the basics and for small projects.
