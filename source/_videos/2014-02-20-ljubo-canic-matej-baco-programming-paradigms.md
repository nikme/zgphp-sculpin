If you have an eye for details you probably noticed that we mentioned this title before. You are right! This is the infamous talk that was canceled day before so visitors witnessed collection of very bad jokes by ZgPHP meetup organizer(s).

Anyway, Ljubo Čanić and Matej Baćo will battle out two programming paradigms - declarative and objective. They started discussing it on our ZgPHP meetup group and only logical solution was to give them center stage on this meetup. Bring popcorn!
